## Overview

**Futuristic Glow Snake Game** is a browser-based Snake clone that combines the charm of the original arcade hit with a vibrant, neon-inspired aesthetic. Your snake glides across a glowing grid, collecting food to grow longer and earn points. As your score climbs, so does the difficulty—new obstacles appear, and the snake’s speed increases. Can you master the levels and maintain your edge as the game intensifies?

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game:** Open `index.html` in your browser. You’ll see a glowing grid and a small snake ready to move.
2. **Collect Food:** Guide the snake to the red/orange foods to earn points and grow longer.
3. **Avoid Collisions:** Don’t run into yourself, the screen edges, or obstacles. Doing so costs a life.
4. **Level Up:** Every 1000 points, you advance a level, which may increase speed and add obstacles. At higher levels, special foods appear—grab them for bonus points!
5. **Keep an Eye on Your Lives:** If you lose a life, a modal will appear. If you have lives left, you can continue from where you left off. If not, it’s Game Over.
