## Overview

**Futuristic Glow Snake Game** is a browser-based Snake clone that combines the charm of the original arcade hit with a vibrant, neon-inspired aesthetic. Your snake glides across a glowing grid, collecting food to grow longer and earn points. As your score climbs, so does the difficulty‚Äînew obstacles appear, and the snake‚Äôs speed increases. Can you master the levels and maintain your edge as the game intensifies?

---

## Features

- **Neon Visuals:** A lively, futuristic design with glowing snake segments, special foods, and sci-fi-level announcements.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Speed ramps up, obstacles appear, and special foods grant bonus points as you advance through levels.
- **Multiple Lives:** Start with three lives to give yourself room for error. Lose a life, and you‚Äôll get a chance to continue‚Äîno need to restart immediately.
- **Special Food & Power-Ups:** Beyond ordinary snacks, special glowing foods appear at higher levels, rewarding you with big points.
- **High Score Tracking:** Show off your highest score and challenge yourself or friends to beat it.
- **Responsive Design:** Automatically scales the canvas for smaller screens, ensuring the game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Play

2. **Collect Food:** Guide the snake to the red/orange foods to earn points and grow longer.
3. **Avoid Collisions:** Don‚Äôt run into yourself, the screen edges, or obstacles. Doing so costs a life.
4. **Level Up:** Every 1000 points, you advance a level, which may increase speed and add obstacles. At higher levels, special foods appear‚Äîgrab them for bonus points!
5. **Keep an Eye on Your Lives:** If you lose a life, a modal will appear. If you have lives left, you can continue from where you left off. If not, it‚Äôs Game Over.
